# **Axiom Set for Curvature-First Geometry ("Adaptive Pi Geometry")**

This document provides a complete foundational axiom set for a geometry where curves—not lines—are the primitive objects. This system is designed for maximum clarity, rigor, and adaptability, suitable for documentation, publication, or formal system-building.

---

### **Axiom 1: Curvature Primacy**

*Every geometric path is fundamentally a curve. The notion of a perfectly straight line is not admitted; any path that appears straight is a curve with vanishingly small curvature.*

---

### **Axiom 2: Curve Construction**

*For any two points in the space, there exists at least one curve connecting them, characterized by a continuous and finite curvature function over its domain.*

---

### **Axiom 3: Curvature Composition**

*Complex geometric forms are constructed through the composition, intersection, and transformation of curves. All higher-order objects (surfaces, solids) are defined via sets or envelopes of curves.*

---

### **Axiom 4: Parametric Representation**

*Every curve admits a parametric representation (e.g., Bézier, B-spline, or equivalent), and all geometric operations—including intersection, subdivision, and deformation—are defined in terms of these representations.*

---

### **Axiom 5: Curvature Continuity**

*The curvature function of a geometric object is continuous except at prescribed singularities (e.g., cusps or corners), which must be explicitly defined and are not generic.*

---

### **Axiom 6: Measurement and Distance**

*Distance, length, and other metric properties are computed as integrals over the curve's parametric domain, respecting its curvature at all scales. There is no metric defined for perfectly straight paths.*

---

### **Axiom 7: Transformation Invariance**

*All geometric objects and operations are covariant under smooth (differentiable) transformations, including translation, rotation, scaling, and deformation, provided that curve continuity and finite curvature are preserved.*

---

### **Axiom 8: Approximate Straightness**

*A path may approach "straightness" only as the limiting case of curvature tending toward zero. However, such a path remains a curve within the system and never attains exact zero curvature.*

---

### **Axiom 9: Physical Correspondence**

*Geometric entities must be constructible or representable in physical reality, acknowledging that no physical path is perfectly straight at all scales; thus, all geometry models the intrinsic curvature of the real world.*

---

### **Axiom 10: Hierarchical Construction**

*All complex geometric structures (networks, surfaces, volumes) are hierarchically constructed from fundamental curve elements, and their properties emerge from the properties and relationships of these curves.*

---

## **Computational Axiom**

*All geometric objects are representable in a finite, computable form (such as control points for parametric curves), ensuring practical implementation in software, hardware, and physical modeling.*

## **Summary Table**

| Principle                 | Adaptive Pi Axiom                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive element         | Curve                                        |
| Connection of points      | Always by a curve                            |
| Straightness              | Only as a limiting case, not exact           |
| Metric/measurement        | Integral over curve; no straight line metric |
| Operations                | Parametric; composition, intersection        |
| Real-world correspondence | Always models finite curvature               |
